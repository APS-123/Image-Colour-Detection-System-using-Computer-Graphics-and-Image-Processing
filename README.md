# Image-Colour-Detection-System-using-Computer-Graphics-and-Image-Processing
This project develops an Image Color Detection System using Computer Graphics and Image Processing techniques. It analyzes images to identify multiple dominant colors using K-Means clustering and pixel analysis. The system extracts RGB values, classifies colors like grey, beige, and brown, and shows color distribution.
